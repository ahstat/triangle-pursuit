**Triangle pursuit** is a program computing recurrent sequences as described in this blog post: https://ahstat.github.io/Triangle-pursuit/ It also offers generalization for different rules, different norms, larger number of initial points and higher dimensions.

**Documentation**

The `main.R` file is self-documented, so you can follow it line by line.
You can keep option `verbose = TRUE` to understand each function through multiple examples.
